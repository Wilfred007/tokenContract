WFToken Contract


Description

The WFToken contract is a simple implementation of an ERC-20-like token with basic functionalities for minting and burning tokens. It is designed to store token details, manage balances, and allow users to increase or decrease the token supply.
Features

    Token Details:
        Public variables store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.
    Mapping of Balances:
        A mapping links addresses to their respective balances.
    Minting Functionality:
        Allows the creation of new tokens and updates the total supply and the balance of the specified address.
    Burning Functionality:
        Enables token destruction, reducing both the total supply and the balance of the specified address, with checks to ensure sufficient balance.
